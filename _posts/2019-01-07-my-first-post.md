# __My First Post__

  I've never thought of myself as a writer. In fact, I'm sure I'm not a writer. A writer is someone who puts their ideas out there knowing
  there will be people who will judge them, but that doesn't stop them. They write anyway. Does the criticism cut them deep at times? Of
  course. Nevertheless, they trudge on. Maybe--through the inspiration of their writing--they'll change the world. Maybe they won't. Either
  way, I want to be one of these people. The ones that write, write, and write no matter the consequences. I'm not a writer. Not _yet_.
